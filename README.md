# Implementation of a simple 3D-Tetris


#### This is a program for a 3D version of the classic Tetris game!

We are using p5.js to power the game, the easiest way to play is to deploy a local server using the Live Server extension on Visual Studio Code.

#### Also, you can try a web version on https://hectorhernandezalfonso.github.io/not-3d-tetris/pages/tetris.html
